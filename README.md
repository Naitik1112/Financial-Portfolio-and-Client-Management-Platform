# 💼 Financial Portfolio and Client Management Platform

A full-stack platform designed for **financial advisors** to seamlessly manage clients' mutual funds, fixed deposits, and insurance (life & general) portfolios from a centralized dashboard. It automates SIP deductions, handles taxation via FIFO redemption logic, and generates dynamic performance reports—eliminating the inefficiencies of Excel-based workflows.

---

## 🧩 Problem

Financial advisors often work with clients whose investments are spread across multiple institutions, each offering separate platforms. Due to this:

- Advisors rely on **manual Excel sheets** to track mutual funds, insurance, and debt funds.
- Generating client reports and calculating taxes becomes **error-prone and time-consuming**.
- There's **no way to group family clients** or automate SIPs and redemptions efficiently.
- As the client base scales, managing performance and data becomes chaotic.

## ✅ Solution

This platform solves the above by offering:

- 🔗 **Unified client dashboard** to track all investments.
- 🔁 **Automated SIP deductions** and redemptions using `node-cron` and **RabbitMQ** for async task execution.
- 📊 **Performance dashboards** with filtering options (monthly/quarterly/yearly).
- 📄 **Dynamic PDF & Excel reports** with auto-email delivery using `Nodemailer`.
- 📦 **Redis caching** to handle large data sets (up to 34,000+ entries).
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Group management** to combine portfolios (e.g., family-based reports).
- 🧾 **Tax calculation** based on FIFO logic for redemptions.
- 🔒 **Insurance claim tracking** (life & general).
- 💰 **Fixed deposit management** with maturity tracking.
